        <h3>Playing with color.</h3>

        <p>
          Make no mistake - At Everlane, we love whitespace. That's not to say we don't love color,
          too, though. In fact, one of our favorite games is
          <a href="http://blendoku.com/">Blendoku</a>, which is an addictive zen-like game about
          arranging colors along multiple gradients.
        </p>

        <p>
          We like it so much that we decided it would be pretty cool to blend code and color in a
          fun challenge - playing Blendoku algorithmically. Check out the
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6FITZ7p5FM">gameplay video</a> to get a sense
          for what it's about.

        <h3>The challenge.</h3>

        <p>
          The goal is essentially to write a bot that can solve Blendoku levels. Data describing the
          levels will be provided to you in JSON, and you simply have to write a routine that can
          decide where to put all the unassigned colors, and spit out a similar representation in
          JSON.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll also have a few sample levels with their solutions given. The example level on the
          right will be a part of that sample set.

        <h3>The rules, or "Will it Blend?"</h3>

        <p>
          A Blendoku level is solved if every contiguous row or column is a linear color gradient.
          A color is on a gradient between two start and end colors if it, for some value of x
          between 0 and 1:
        </p>
        <pre>startColor * (1-x) + endColor * x = blendColor</pre>
        <p>
          Here, the multiply means "multiply each channel of the color separately." Here's a little
          example to the right to show how the blending works.
